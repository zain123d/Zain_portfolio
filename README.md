# A portfolio consisting of all the work I have done related to the field of Information systems. 

# Project 1

# [Data Visualization using Python in Jupyter Notebook for ChocolateBomberDFW](https://github.com/zain123d/chocolatebomberdfw_dataVisualization/files/6274520/chocolatebomberdfw.-.most.common.payment.type.pdf) 
* Imported Excel sheet with customer information that included item ordered, amount paid, type of medium used for paying, address etc.
* Cleaned out unnecassary columns from the dataset and only kept Amount paid and Type of medium used.
* Grouped the amount paid based on type of medium used to get a sum of total amount for each type.
* Using matplotlib, plotted the data in a Pie chart to display percentage of amount for each type of medium.
* Visualized most common type of medium used for payment. 


## Resources used:
* Python Version: 3.9
* Packages used: pandas, numpy and matplotlib

# Project 2

# [Foreign Direct Investment Visualization using Tableau](https://public.tableau.com/profile/zain.ul.abiden#!/vizhome/FDICaseStudy-Zain/Dashboard1) 
* Imported CSV dataset into Tableau 

**Case Study questions included:**

1. Which sector receives the maximum and minimum direct funding for a given year?
2. Is there a trend for direct investments for individual sector?
3. In what fashion can the sectors be group for comparison?
4. Which sectors reported the highest growth and decline in the past 5 years?
5. Which sector reported the most variation overall?
6. What is the proportion of investment between sectors from the FDI perspective?
7. Are there any specific clusters present in the data?
8. Can we forecast the trend for the following year?

## Resources Used:
* Tableau Public; Version 2021.1
* FDI Dataset for the years 2000 till 2016

# Project 3

# [Machine Learning - Prediction Models (Class Assignment)](https://github.com/zain123d/Zain_portfolio/files/6274632/Machine.Learning.Assignment.3.-.Zain.Ul.Abiden.pdf)

* Used a Diabete.csv dataset to create prediction models using Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine and Random Forest.
* Calculated AUC (Area Under the Curve) score for the models and found Logistic Regression in this case was the better option for our prediction model. 
* Used the same dataset to create visualization using:
* 1. K-means to Cluster the points
* 2. Spectral Clustering 
* 3. DBSCAN

* Image Manipulation using Python.
* Reduced the colors in the image to 64, 16 and 8 colors. 

* Imported a dataset "FIFA20" which contained images of famous soccer players.
* Using PCA method, reshaped the data from (200,230400) to (200,200).
* Used elbow and silhouette methods to find the best number of clusters for the images.
* Visualized the clusters using inverse_transform() function in PCA.

## Resources used:
* Python version 3.7
* Jupyter Notebook
* Packages used: pandas, nupmy, sklearn, matplotlib, scipy and PIL
